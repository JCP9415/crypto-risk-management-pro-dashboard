# **BQR Quant Analysis Suite**

### **Institutional‑Grade Quant Power — On a 10‑Year‑Old Lenovo 110S**

Welcome to **BQR (Bank‑Quality Risk)** — a fully featured quant analytics engine delivering hedge‑fund‑class Monte Carlo simulations, risk modeling, stress‑testing, and portfolio diagnostics… all runnable on a **$70 second‑hand laptop**.

This project was designed, refined, broken, rebuilt nine times, and battle‑tested on an ultra‑low‑power machine:

* **2016 Lenovo 110S (BR11)**
* Dual‑core Atom processor
* **2 GB DDR3 RAM**
* **32 GB eMMC storage**

If it runs here, it runs *anywhere*. This is quant analysis for **everyone**, not just for billion‑dollar funds.

## ⚙️ **Design Philosophy**

### **1. Industrial‑Strength Quant Analysis for Retail Users**

BQR brings traditionally exclusive tools — Monte Carlo engines, fat‑tail stress models, forward‑drift pessimistic projections, multi‑asset correlation matrices, and dynamic risk reporting — straight to retail quants, hobbyists, and researchers.

### **2. Bank III Prudence+**

Most tools aim for the classic **70/30 portfolio “prudent person” standard**.
BQR goes farther.

* **100% forward‑looking pessimistic drift** (no rosy assumptions)
* **100% historical risk** (volatility, covariance, drawdowns)
* Built‑in safeguards preventing *optimism bias*

This creates a **prudence buffer** resembling Bank III risk modeling practices — but tuned for modern, hyper‑volatile markets.

### **3. Built for Tiny Machines**

Every algorithm is optimized for small memory footprints and low CPU overhead.

The result: a full quant suite that runs smoothly on hardware weaker than a smartphone.

## 📊 **Standard Monte Carlo vs. BQR Monte Carlo**

| Feature              | Standard Monte Carlo | **BQR Monte Carlo (Bank‑Quality)**           |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Drift                | Historical avg       | **Forward‑looking pessimistic drift**        |
| Volatility           | Historical           | **Historical (full), no smoothing**          |
| Correlations         | Optional             | **Mandatory full‑matrix correlations**       |
| Tail Risk            | Often ignored        | **Fat‑tail, stress scenario overlays**       |
| Robustness           | Consumer‑grade       | **Institutional‑grade**                      |
| Crypto Applicability | Poor                 | **Excellent — tuned for extreme volatility** |

### **Why BQR is Better for Cryptos**

* Crypto returns are **not normally distributed** → BQR handles fat tails.
* Crypto volatility shifts rapidly → BQR uses pessimistic drift.
* Cross‑asset correlation spikes during crashes → BQR models full covariance.
* Most retail tools treat crypto like equities → **BQR treats crypto like crypto**.

## 🛡️ **Prudence Guardrails**

BQR defaults are designed to protect non‑experts:

* Conservative forward drift
* No unrealistic growth assumptions
* Worst‑case scenario overlays enabled
* No unsupervised leverage multipliers

These keep the system compliant with the spirit of **Prudent Person** portfolio standards.

### **Advanced Mode (Warning!)**

If you choose to tweak backend parameters, you will encounter:

> **"You are now moving away from Prudent Person standards. You have been duly warned."**

This is intentional — advanced users can access extreme configurations, but only after acknowledging the risks.

## 🚀 **Features**

* Multi‑asset data ingestion
* Correlation‑aware Monte Carlo simulations
* Forward pessimistic drift modeling
* Stress testing & scenario generation
* Backtesting engine
* Full‑screen visualizations + exportable charts
* Downloadable reports
* Works on ultra‑low‑spec machines

---

## 🧪 **Who is BQR For?**

* Retail traders
* Home quants
* Students
* Researchers
* Crypto portfolio analysts
* Anyone who wants institutional analytics without institutional hardware

---

## 🔧 **Advanced Configuration (Optional)**

Experienced users may modify:

* Drift assumptions
* Covariance blending
* Stress scenario multipliers
* Distribution models
* Simulation granularity

But again — **advanced mode disables prudence protections**.

---

## 🏁 **Summary**

BQR democratizes quant finance.
You get:

* Portfolio analytics normally reserved for hedge funds
* Bank‑grade prudence defaults
* Fully transparent parameters
* A lightweight, efficient engine that runs even on decade‑old hardware

All without sacrificing performance or rigor.

Welcome to **Quant Power for Everyone**.
