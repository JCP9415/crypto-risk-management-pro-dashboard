## 🚀 Mission Statement

This dashboard democratizes crypto quant analysis. It’s built for:

- **Retail traders**, hobbyist quants, and educators
- **Beginner empowerment** through annotated visuals and glossary tooltips
- **Advanced users** who want to tweak backend parameters (but beware:
  _“Moving away from Prudent Person standards. You have been duly warned.”_)

## 🏦 Beyond the 70/30 — Enter Bank III Prudence+

Standard portfolio theory often defaults to a **70/30 equity/bond split**, assuming Gaussian returns and stable regimes. Crypto laughs at that.

**Crypto Risk Manager Pro** embraces:
- **Pessimistic forward drift** modeling
- **Speculative asset caps**
- **Flash crash detection**
- **Kelly Criterion scaling**
- **Volatility-adjusted allocations**
- **Correlation-aware rebalancing**

This isn’t just prudent—it’s **Bank III Prudence+**.
